                The present book proposes a new descriptive model, the so called “Ideation Model” (IM), of the design process from a dual cognitive-engineering perspective, partly,based on existing models from both fields and previous work performed. The model,addresses the issue of modeling the ideation or the front-end phase of the,engineering design/product development process, representing the interface of cognitive psychology and engineering design. Three domains – inspiration,decomposition and integration – and three spaces – problem-space, idea-space and,concept-space are considered as elements of the model.
